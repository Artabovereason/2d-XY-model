# $2d$ XY model using cluster algorithm 

In statistical physics, the XY model in two dimensions provides the paradigmatic example of phase transitions mediated by topological defects (vortices). This project propose a review of how to get the BKT temperature $T_\mathrm{KT}$, the critical temperature $T_c$ along with an intuitive picture of what are the phenomenon explained by this model.

The collaboration was done in-between Amar Bellahsene, Quentin Fenoy, and I (Pierre Guichard).
